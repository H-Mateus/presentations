# Two high-level approaches

### Top-down proteomics

- Uses intact whole proteins
- Limited to only a investigating a small number of predefined proteins
- Good for looking at protein modifications (e.g. phosphorylations)

### Bottom-up proteomics

- Proteins are digested into peptides
- Can be used to examination of protein subsets, but also for characterising the whole proteome

Basic steps:
 1. Enzymatically digest proteins into peptides
 1. Sort the peptides using high-performance liquid chromatography
 1. Feed this into a mass spectrometer which fragments the peptides further and measures the mass/charge of the resulting fragments

???

- we're using [S-TRAP](https://protifi.com/pages/s-trap) kit from a company called Protifi to prep the samples
- It's a system for binding the proteins, allowing you to clean any contaminates, denature the proteins and digest them to peptides
- trypsin cuts at lysine and arginine

# Mass resolution matters

- Resolution is mass spectrometry relates to the width of a peak at a given hight (typically 50% peak height) .footnote[Image taken from: `r AutoCite(bib, c("eidhammer_computational_2007"))`]


.center[
```{r, label='monoisotopic-peak', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/monoisotopic_peak.png")
```
]

???

- use of isotopes to figure out charge - carbon 13, if next peak is +1m/z, then ion is plus one, if it's plus +2 then it'd be +0.5m/z
- this can cause problems at larger masses as it becomes less likely there is a peak with no carbon 13

# Fragmentation ladders

- Bonds are weaker between amino acids as opposed to within them, therefore the $b_i$ and $y_i$ fragments are of most interest

# Interpretable ion ladder

# Interpretable ion ladder

- we get a range of potential sequences with different scores

# Peptide identification

- ***De Novo* search**: sequence a peptide by building a graph of observed amino acid distances in a spectrum. Then find a path that explains the peptide mass and e.g., most of the observed peaks
- **Spectral library matching**: compare against previously observed or predicted spectra
- **Database search**: Generate theoretical spectra and compare against observed ones .footnote[Image taken from: `r AutoCite(bib, c("duncan_pros_2010"))`]

.center[
```{r, label='database-search', out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/database_search.jpg")
```
]

???

- you get multiple PSM scores for different matches returned, not just the best score
- intensities aren't typically computed in the *in-silico* spectra, but there are modern methods that attempt this
- there are also methods that try to predict retention time

---

# False discovery rates

- Problem: there's uncertainty in matches, we need a means to quantify and correct for inaccurate matches
- Solution: Create decoy sequences to match against to compute the ratio of false targets

$$FDR = \frac{\#decoys}{\#targets}$$

- Reversing sequences in database is a common way to make the decoys

FDR from posterior error probabilities (PEP):
- e.g. [PeptideProphet](http://proteinprophet.sourceforge.net/)
- fit a mixture model (true hit / false hit) to score distributions

Post-processing:
- e.g. [Percolator](http://percolator.ms/): machine learning to discriminate between correct and incorrect PSMs
- can improve results is score of individual spectra are not easily comparable (not well calibrated)

# Data acquisition techniques

- Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM): good for quantitation of pre-selected protein/s (succeeded MRM)
- Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA): good for comprehensive detection of whole proteome
- **Data Independent Acquisition (DIA): hybrid that aims to do both**
