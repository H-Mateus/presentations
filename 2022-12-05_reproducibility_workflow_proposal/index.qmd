## Thanks to bad incentives

> "Today I wouldn't get an academic job. It's as simple as that. I don't think I would be regarded as productive enough" Peter Higgs (The Guardian, 6 Dec 2013)

> "I've been on a number of search committees. I don't remember anybody looking at anybody's papers. Number and IF \[impact factor\] of pubs are what counts." Terry McGlynn (realscientists) (21 October 2015, 4:12 p.m. Tweet.)

-   Publish or perish. Newly hired biologies have almost twice as many publications as they did a decade ago.[@smaldino_natural_2016]

## So many examples

-   Brain-wide association studies, median sample size: 25, sample size needed to be robust: \>1000 [@marek_reproducible_2022]
-   That time a tower of over 400 false studies was conducted around 5-HTTLPR and depression, good summary [here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/) [@border_no_2019]
-   There are lots of great selfish reasons to purse reproducibly too! [@markowetz_five_2015]
-   And of course, the somewhat recent seminal amyloid paper that is [suspected to be dodgy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/23/alzheimers-study-fraudulent) [@lesne_specific_2006]

## Moving beyond idealogy

-   I propose we work towards building a practical workflow for embedding reproducibility throughout all projects:
    -   Built around a [GitHub organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) (Either at the centre or group level)
    -   Employ self-documented templates for consistent folder structure
    -   Agree on standardised file naming conventions (descriptive, human and machine readable, sane default ordering and search)

## An example - you have a new hypothesis

1.  Copy the template to a new repository
2.  Begin planning: Use [Project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) for building timelines and assigning tasks/deadlines to specific users (students/post-docs)
3.  First aim for a [registered report](https://peercommunityin.org/2020/01/15/submit-your-preregistration-to-peer-community-in-for-peer-review/)
4.  Use [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to track ideas, tasks and troubleshooting (protocols)
5.  Use literate programming approach ([Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), etc) for writing all documentation (notes, papers, slides, etc)

## Incorporating funding

-   If funding isn't already in place, one could use the registered report and repo to showcase budgets, timelines, lay summaries on your own terms (no need to adapt to asinine funder-specific structures)
-   Begin experiments as normal, being sure to continue using the GitHub repo to update progress (tasks completed, delays, troubleshooting, etc.)
-   Keep project contributions of any size logged on the repo (acknowledgement for technicians/RAs and others)

## Write up and publish

-   Write up paper and publish as normal (ideally avoiding for-profit journals, and sticking to [diamond open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access))
-   Share raw data either on GitHub repo, or provide links to location on other repositories (and ideally pre-processed data)
-   Provide container with computational environment used for analysis ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/))
