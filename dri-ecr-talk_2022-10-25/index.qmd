## ECR informatics committee

- We try to serve the community of "informatics" folk (we're very inclusive!) - website [here](https://ukdri.github.io/ECR-Informatics-Committee/)
- Current recurring events:
    - Behind the P-value - A exploration of a piece of analyse someone has done (e.g. explaining how a figure was made)
    - Bytes cafe - A more casual chat, starts with "discoveries" where were share handy things we've found (packages, functions, papers, videos, etc), then have breakout rooms to discuss topics of interest
        - Next one is later this month, sign up!

## Recommendation: learn to code!

- If you're gonna be doing the same types of experiments over and over, then you're doing the same analysis over and over
    - So if you have code for that analyse you'll save loads of time, minimise mistakes and improve reproducibility!
- It's also great for the old CV!
- Some resource recommendations:
    - [R for data science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) - a nice free book
    - [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) - an R package for learning R in R!
    - There're loads of YouTube videos, find one you like ([here is an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ0bV2Afkjc&pp=ygUQciBmb3Igc2NpZW50aXN0cw%3D%3D))

## Another recommendation

-   [QuartoÂ®](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
-   It's an excellent and versatile framework for reproducible and shareable articles, notes, presentations, websites, books (thesis!) and more
-   I wrote my PhD thesis with the precursor to Quarto (RMarkdown - it was real helpful!)

## Reproducibility good!

- There is the reproducibility working group, join if you're interested!
- [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) is a great resource and community focused around how to do reproducible science
- I'm always happy to chat and support folk in this space
    - Would a bunch of you like any events related to this? A workshop, seminar, other training? Let me know!

## Some examples

1.  [The FayLab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)
    -   This is a website aimed at new and current lab members which outlines the culture (inclusive, reproducible and open-science) the lab want to foster and codifies the structure of projects (e.g. file naming conventions!)
2.  [My own website](https://gmbernardoharrington.netlify.app/blog/2022-10-21-testing-normality-in-r/)
    -   A great way of sharing methods (especially for stats)
