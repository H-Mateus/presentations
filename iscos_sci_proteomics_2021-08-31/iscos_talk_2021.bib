  abstract = {Human serums contain a protein antigenically related to protein AA, the principal protein of a major class of amyloid substance. The serum antigen, SAA, occurs mainly in a high molecular weight form, 1 to 2 X 10(5). This work shows that the bulk of the SAA sediments at density 1.12 g/cm3 and floats at density 1.21 g/cm3, as does the high density lipoprotein HDL3. SAA is associated with the apolipoproteins ApoA-I and ApoA-II. The total cholesterol:total protein ratio of the fraction with density 1.12-1.21 g/cm3 is 0.2:1, consistent with that of SAA constituent of the HDL3 fraction into low molecular weight species of the order of 13,000. The quantity of SAA may vary from 0.1\% or more of the total protein of HDL3.},

  abstract = {Neurological outcomes following spinal cord injury (SCI) are currently difficult to predict. Whilst the initial American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade can give an estimate of outcome, the high remaining degree of uncertainty has stoked recent interest in biomarkers for SCI. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of routinely measured blood biomarkers by developing prognostic models of AIS scores at discharge and 12-months post-injury. Routine blood and clinical data were collected from SCI patients (n=427) and blood measures that had been assessed in less than 50\% of patients were excluded. Outcome neurology was obtained from AIS and Spinal cord independence measure III (SCIM-III) scores at discharge and 12-months post-injury, with motor (AIS) and sensory (AIS, touch and prick) abilities being assessed individually. Linear regression models with and without elastic net penalisation were created for all outcome measures. Blood measures associated with liver function such as alanine transaminase were found to add value to predictions of SCIM-III at discharge and 12-months post-injury. Furthermore, components of a total blood count including haemoglobin were found to add value to predictions of AIS motor and sensory scores at discharge and 12-month post-injury. These findings corroborate the results of our previous preliminary study and thus provide further evidence that routine blood measures can add prognostic value in SCI, and that markers of liver function are of particular interest.},

  abstract = {Objective Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) elicits immediate neural cell death, axonal damage, and disruption of the blood\textendash spinal cord barrier, allowing circulating immune cells and blood proteins into the spinal parenchyma. The inflammatory response to SCI involves robust complement system activation, which contributes to secondary injury and impairs neurological recovery. This study aimed to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), an FDA-approved treatment for inflammatory conditions, can scavenge complement activation products and improve recovery from contusive SCI. Methods We used functional testing, noninvasive imaging, and detailed postmortem analysis to assess whether IVIg therapy is effective in a mouse model of severe contusive SCI. Results IVIg therapy at doses of 0.5\textendash 2 g/kg improved the functional and histopathological outcomes from SCI, conferring protection against lesion enlargement, demyelination, central canal dilation, and axonal degeneration. The benefits of IVIg were detectable through noninvasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with IVIg treatment counteracting the progressive SCI-induced increase in radial diffusivity (RD) in white matter. Diffusion indices significantly correlated with the functional performance of individual mice and accurately predicted the degree of myelin preservation. Further experiments revealed that IVIg therapy reduced the presence of complement activation products and phagocytically active macrophages at the lesion site, providing insight as to its mechanisms of action. Interpretation Our findings highlight the potential of using IVIg as an immunomodulatory treatment for SCI, and the value of DTI to assess tissue damage and screen for the efficacy of candidate intervention strategies in preclinical models of SCI, both quantitatively and noninvasively.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in the identification of biomarkers that could predict neurological outcome following a spinal cord injury (SCI). Although initial American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade is a good indicator of neurological outcome, for the patient and clinicians, an element of uncertainty remains. This preliminary study aimed to assess the additive potential of routine blood analytes following principal component analysis (PCA) to develop prognostic models for neurological outcome following SCI. Routine blood and clinical data were collected from SCI patients (n\,=\,82) and PCA used to reduce the number of blood analytes into related factors. Outcome neurology was obtained from AIS scores at 3 and 12 months post-injury, with motor (AIS and total including all myotomes) and sensory (AIS, touch and pain) abilities being assessed individually. Multiple regression models were created for all outcome measures. Blood analytes relating to ``liver function'' and ``acute inflammation and liver function'' factors were found to significantly increase prediction of neurological outcome at both 3 months (touch, pain, and AIS sensory) and at 1 year (pain, R2 increased by 0.025 and total motor, R2 increased by 0.016). For some models ``liver function'' and ``acute inflammation and liver function'' factors were both significantly predictive, with the greatest combined R2 improvement of 0.043 occurring for 3 month pain prediction. These preliminary findings support ongoing research into the use of routine blood analytes in the prediction of neurological outcome in SCI patients.},

  abstract = {Retinol plays a vital role in the immune response to infection, yet proteins that mediate retinol transport during infection have not been identified. Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are strongly induced in the liver by systemic infection and in the intestine by bacterial colonization, but their exact functions remain unclear. Here we show that mouse and human SAAs are retinol binding proteins. Mouse and human SAAs bound retinol with nanomolar affinity, were associated with retinol in vivo, and limited the bacterial burden in tissues after acute infection. We determined the crystal structure of mouse SAA3 at a resolution of 2 \AA, finding that it forms a tetramer with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. Our results thus identify SAAs as a family of microbe-inducible retinol binding proteins, reveal a unique protein architecture involved in retinol binding, and suggest how retinol is circulated during infection.},

  abstract = {The liver is essential for numerous physiological processes, including filtering blood from the intestines, metabolizing fats, proteins, carbohydrates and drugs, and regulating iron storage and release. The liver is also an important immune organ and plays a critical role in response to infection and injury throughout the body. Liver functions are regulated by autonomic parasympathetic innervation from the brainstem and sympathetic innervation from the thoracic spinal cord. Thus, spinal cord injury (SCI) at or above thoracic levels disrupts major regulatory mechanisms for hepatic functions. Work in rodents and humans shows that SCI induces liver pathology, including hepatic inflammation and fat accumulation characteristic of a serious form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This hepatic pathology is associated with and likely contributes to indices of metabolic dysfunction often noted in SCI individuals, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. These occur at greater rates in the SCI population and can negatively impact health and quality of life. In this review, we will: 1) Discuss acute and chronic changes in human and rodent liver pathology and function after SCI; 2) Describe how these hepatic changes affect systemic inflammation, iron regulation and metabolic dysfunction after SCI; 3) Describe how disruption of the hepatic autonomic nervous system may be a key culprit in post-injury chronic liver pathology; and 4) Preview ongoing and future research that aims to elucidate mechanisms driving liver and metabolic dysfunction after SCI.},

  abstract = {Inducible expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) is a hallmark of the acute-phase response, which is a conserved reaction of vertebrates to environmental challenges such as tissue injury, infection and surgery. Human SAA1 is encoded by one of the four SAA genes and is the best-characterized SAA protein. Initially known as a major precursor of amyloid A (AA), SAA1 has been found to play an important role in lipid metabolism and contributes to bacterial clearance, the regulation of inflammation and tumor pathogenesis. SAA1 has five polymorphic coding alleles (SAA1.1\textendash SAA1.5) that encode distinct proteins with minor amino acid substitutions. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified in both the coding and non-coding regions of human SAA1. Despite high levels of sequence homology among these variants, SAA1 polymorphisms have been reported as risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and several types of cancer. A recently solved crystal structure of SAA1.1 reveals a hexameric bundle with each of the SAA1 subunits assuming a 4-helix structure stabilized by the C-terminal tail. Analysis of the native SAA1.1 structure has led to the identification of a competing site for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and heparin, thus providing the structural basis for a role of heparin and heparan sulfate in the conversion of SAA1 to AA. In this brief review, we compares human SAA1 with other forms of human and mouse SAAs, and discuss how structural and genetic studies of SAA1 have advanced our understanding of the physiological functions of the SAA proteins.},
