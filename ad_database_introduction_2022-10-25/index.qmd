## What is Alzhimer's disease (AD)?

- [AD](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease) is the most common form of dementia
- Dementia is the name for a set of symptoms that includes memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language
- The underlying cause of AD is currently unknown, but we know that AD brains accumulate protein deposits that form 'plaques' and 'tangles'
- Importantly, AD is a progressive disease, meaning more symptoms develop, and they get worse, over time

## What's this database lark then?

- Cardiff University has collected many projects with various funders resulting in different cohorts of data relating to dementia (mainly AD) over several decades
- These cohorts have been collated together into a single database, so that we can better leverage the data for analysis

## So what's actually in the database?

-   The data is from interviews and includes a variety of cognitive assessments, education/employment, family history of dementia, medications/co-morbidities and more
-   Much of the data is longitudinal, with participants being revisited to get a sense of their trajectory
-   We have several cohorts stretching back decades, so not all cohorts have the same information (different versions of a given cognitive assessment may have been used as newer versions were released for example)

## What sort of questions might we explore with it?

- Well there're loads we might ask!
- But one aspect our group is particularly interest in, is comparing early- and late-onset (EOAD/LOAD) Alzheimer's disease
- So, I would suggest that you could compare the trajectories of EOAD and LOAD participants in known risk factors (like low education, diabetes, hypertension, etc)
- However, if there's a particular angle **you'd** be interested in tackling with this data, I'm very happy to discuss other ideas!

## The data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

-   Before we get into what data we have, you should know how it is stored
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source relational database engine
-   The data is stored in this due to both it's abundance, and the fact that it was a bit of a mess...
-   So the data was cleaned up and organised into discrete tables with linking IDs

## How could one access the data?

-   There're a few ways:
    -   You could use SQL queries to see what data is there and extract what you want for use in your analysis software of choice
    -   You could use other software that can connect to the database, such as the GUI [dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), or certain R/Python packages that let you pull data straight into their respective environments
    -   I'll showcase how to do this with R in later slides, and give you sense of the data whilst we're at it

## Don't panic!

-   Rest assured, if you struggle with, or just don't fancy tackling the database yourself, I'm happy to assist with getting the data out into a plain-text format you can use
-   Having said that, let's see how scary it might be :P

## Connecting via R

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

## I use librarian to both install/load packages
library(librarian)
pkg <- c("tidyverse", "RPostgreSQL", "janitor", "gt", "qrcode")
shelf(pkg)
rm(pkg)

## then we need to build a connection object:
## first, load the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
## then define the connection parameters
## note that "con" will be used later in each connection to the database
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "ad_phenotype_db",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "mateusbernardo-harrington")
```

## Testing the connection

```{r}
## the package has several helper functions we can use
## for example, to list all the tables in the database:
dbListTables(con)
```

## Extracting tables

```{r}
## we can pull a given table like so
education_df <- dbReadTable(con, "education")
gt(head(education_df))
```

## Something fancier

```{r}
## we can do something more fancy too, 
## like join different tables using SQL queries

## we first need the query as a string
query <- "
SELECT p.participant_id, p.case_control, p.early_or_late_onset_p, p.sex,
       e.d1_years_in_education
  FROM participant_info AS p
       JOIN visit AS v
           ON p.export_identifier = v.export_identifier
       JOIN education AS e
           ON v.visit_id = e.visit_id;
"
## we can then save the query result as a dataframe
df <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
```

## Then we can work some R magic!

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(early_or_late_onset_p) %>%
  summarise(
    num = n(),
    mean_years_in_education = mean(d1_years_in_education, na.rm = T)
  ) %>%
  gt()
```

## Or make a nice plot

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center
df %>%
    dplyr::filter(case_control == "AD case") %>%
    ggplot(aes(case_control, d1_years_in_education,
               fill = early_or_late_onset_p)) +
    geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +
    ## set colourblind friendly palette
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PiYG") +
    xlab("Cohort") +
    ylab("Years in education") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "top",
          legend.direction = "horizontal") +
    labs(fill = "Onset", caption = paste0("Years in education by cohort - ",
                                          Sys.Date()))
```
