## The data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

-   Before we get into what data we have, you should know how it is stored
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source relational database engine
-   The data is stored in this was due to both it's abundance, and the fact that it was a bit of a mess...
-   There is actually a single `.csv` file with all the data you could use if you wanted to, though I'd advice against this (it has nearly 4K rows and over 1K columns)

## How could one access the data

-   There're a few ways:
    -   You could use SQL query to see what data is there and extract what you want for use in your analysis software of choice
    -   You could use other software that can connect to the database, such as the GUI [dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), or certain R/Python packages that let you pull data straight into their respective environments
    -   I'll showcase how to do this with R in later slides, and give you sense of the data whilst we're at it

## Don't panic!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Rest assured, if you struggle with, or just don't fancy tackling the database yourself, I'm happy to assist with getting the data out into a plain-text format you can use
-   Having said that, let's see how scary it might be :P

## Connecting via R

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

## I use librarian to both install/load packages
library(librarian)
pkg <- c("tidyverse", "RPostgreSQL", "janitor", "gt")
shelf(pkg)
rm(pkg)

## then we need to build a connection object:
## first, load the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
## then define the connection parameters
## note that "con" will be used later in each connection to the database
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "ad_phenotype_db",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "mateusbernardo-harrington")
```

## Testing the connection

```{r}
## the package has several helper functions we can use
## for example, to list all the tables in the database:
dbListTables(con)
```

## Extracting tables

```{r}
## we can pull a given table like so
education_df <- dbReadTable(con, "education")
gt(head(education_df))
```

## So what's actualy in the database?

-   The data is from interviews and includes a variety of cognitive assessments, education/employment, family history of dementia, medications/co-morbidities and more
-   Much of the data is longitudinal, with participants being revisited to get a sense of their trajectory
-   We have several cohorts stretching back decades, so not all cohorts have the same information (different versions of a given cognitive assessment may have been used as newer versions were released for example)

## What sort of questions might we explore?

- Well there're loads we might ask!
- But one aspect our group is particularly interest in, is comparing early- and late-onset (EOAD/LOAD) Alzheimer's disease
- So, I would suggest that you could compare the trajectories of EOAD and LOAD participants in known risk factors (like low education, diabetes, hypertension, etc)
- However, if there's a particular angle **you'd** be interested in tackling with this data, I'm very happy to discuss other ideas!

## Thanks for your attention! {.final-slide background-image="images/title_background.png" style="color: #0ac8ff;"}
