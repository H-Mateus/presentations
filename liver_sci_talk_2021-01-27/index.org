#+TITLE: SCI and the liver
#+AUTHOR: Gabriel Mateus Bernardo Harrington
#+SUBTITLE: What's the link?
#+DATE: 2021-01-27

* How did I get here?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
+ First [[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2019.6495][couple]] of [[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2020.7144][papers]] found markers of liver function add value to predictions of neurological outcomes
+ Proteomic work seems to suggest something similar
+ As it turns out, there be literature about it as well

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ talk about heterogeneity on SCI population - impact on new therapies, mental health, etc
+ go over papers briefly - blood vs csf, value of biomarkers
#+END_NOTES

* The livers response to trauma
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="width: 70%">
[[file:sci_liver_loop.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Trauma leads to inflammatory cytokines in the blood
+ They reach the liver and triggers an "Acute phase response"
+ This eventually settles down, except when it doesn't (SCI + TBI)
+ So what makes SCI (and TBI) different?
#+END_NOTES

* SCI promotes chronic liver steatosis
[[file:liver_stages.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Chronic fat accumulation in liver observed months-years post-injury in animals and humans
  - non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
+ When accompanied by liver inflammation a more advanced stage -> non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (10-fold increase in liver-related death)
+ Both are treatable, managed by diet and exercise, but if left untreated -> cirrhosis -> death
+ NAFLD closely linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
+ In addition to increased morbitiry and mortality
#+END_NOTES

* Intuition + reading = ideas
+ Difference prior to injury?
  - pre-damaged liver due to lifestyle (drink/diet/etc)
  - Genetics
+ Damage to sympathetic and parasympathetic signalling (T7-T12)?
+ "Leaky gut" -> microbiome bacteria + toxins in blood -> unhappy liver?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ para/sympathetic signalling unlikely to be main cause as same observed in TBI, pre-clinical models of multiple sclerosis
+ Evidence for leaky gut:
  - gut permeability found to increase 20% in rat SCI model
  - genes encoding epithelial tight junctions found to be differentially expressed
#+END_NOTES

* Potential future work
+ Reanalyse "Yakult" study data
+ RNA seq on patient bloods, validate proteomics and allow for pathway analysis
+ Modelling of routine blood data from Glasgow trauma centre, validate initial modelling and compare bloods closer to initial injury
